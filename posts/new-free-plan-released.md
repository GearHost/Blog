We're happy to announce the release of our all new Free CloudSite plan. This plan boasts a ton of new features, improvements making it bigger, better, faster and now gluten free. But why the change? Let's get into the thought process behind that, how we designed the new plan, what it has to offer and how it affects you.

### Why the change?
For the past several weeks we have been running some data models to help us understand how customers have been using the all new GearHost. With the growth of 1,000+ new customers a month we have a good amount of data to look at and what we found was pretty interesting. In short we realized that while a lot of developers liked the free tier to develop their applications before going live in general customers wanted a lower cost solution to simple low resource sites. The free tier wouldn't work as it did not support custom domains so we grabbed some coke and potato chips and got to think'n.

### Out with the old
We launched GearHost with a free tier originally to offer developers the ability to develop code on our platform for free before a site\application went live. That works well and we've seen a lot of people take advantage of this feature. We limited free to this because we though if you had an actual working application you should be paying for it. Right? Well yes and no.

### In with the new
While it's completely realistic for any company to charge for a service they offer it's all about what you're getting. It's the same idea of going to a restaurant and getting free chips and salsa, free bread, etc. The fact is if you have a pretty active site or need a good amount of resources you'll be on the GearHost platform. There isn't anyone better but what about all the other low resource sites you have for family, friends, small businesses, etc? Wouldn't it be great if you could host those for free on the same cloud as your large scale sites? We thought so too!

### It's all about the details
The new free tier plan contains a good amount of resources for low usage sites. It's noteworth to point out however that the free tier is not on some servers we've set aside because it's "free", this is in the same cloud as your Standard and Reserved CloudSite apps and has the same quality of service for uptime, performance and features. We only limit the actual resource usage. Here are the details:

- ***Custom Domains***
- ***Shared** Web Node*
- ***1** Max Worker*
- ***256MB** Application Pool*
- ***5%** CPU Usage, **25%** burst for up to 5 min allowed*
- ***1GB** Bandwidth /mo.*
- ***100MB** SSD Storage*

In addition each GearHost account is allowed up to 100 Free CloudSite applications and 100 free databases but you will have to verify your account first. Without verification the limit is set to 5 free tier applications and databases.

### How does it affect me?
If you have been great! If not we encourage you to take it for a spin. Run a WordPress site, an MVC application you've been playing around with, a friends site, etc. And as always share the love on Twitter [@gearhost](https://twitter.com/gearhost).
