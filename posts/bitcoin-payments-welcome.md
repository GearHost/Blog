# Bitcoin payments welcome

We are excited to be part of the growing Bitcoin community! Through our partnership with [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), GearHost now accepts Bitcoin payments for cloud hosting services! This is in combination with our already existing credit card and PayPal payments. To learn more about what is Bitcoin, [watch this quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc2en3nHxA4).

### How it works
Payments made with Bitcoin are similar to PayPal in that you deposit funds into your account. The funds show as a credit on your account. Any payments for services that are due automatically deduct from your account credit first.

### How to use it
Under Billing > Payment Details you will see a new option named Bitcoin Payment where you can select an amount in USD to pay using bitcoins. Once selected you will be redirected to our Coinbase payment page where you can pay from your Bitcoin wallet or Coinbase wallet. Once your payment has been verified you will be redirected back to GearHost where you credit will be shown for the amount you deposited.

### What about Ethereum?
Coinbase now supports ether trading which will allow you to convert your ether to Bitcoin that can be used with GearHost.

As with everything else GearHost is focused on providing the latest technologies to our customers. We hope this alternative payment method is something you will enjoy!
